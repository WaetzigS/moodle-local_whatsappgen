# PURPOSE

For many participants and in situations where you need a fast reply from them, WhatsApp is more effective. With this plugin, you can create messages with placeholders, such as name, etc., and send them to the participants.

This plugin is not intended for sending bulk messages for non-educational or commercial purposes.

For trainers, it's easy to navigate to the course members, select the participants, craft one message, and generate this message for all the selected participants.

# SETTINGS

In the settings you can set this:

1. Maximum generated messages at once
The performance depends on your hardware. For each participant, a new browser tab will open. Some devices may struggle with handling many browser tabs simultaneously. To manage this, you can set a limit. If you try to generate messages beyond this limit, you will receive a notification, and the system will prevent you from generating the messages. We advice to choose the limit of maximum 10.

2. Default Default WhatsApp Number
Please select the user field where you save the WhatsApp numbers. You can save these numbers in the "Phone" or "Smartphone" user fields. The system will use this field to generate the message for the respective number.

3. Allow Roles
Here, you can set the default roles that are allowed to use this plugin and create messages. Please note that after the creation, the number of participants will be displayed.

4. Tracking in Database
You can set up database tracking in the whatsappgen_messages table here. This allows you to see which users created messages for which participants. Please note that creating a message does not guarantee it is sent. It's possible that the WhatsApp number is invalid or not available in the system.

# FAQ

1. How do I insert the phone numbers of the participants?
Please enter the phone numbers in the user-edit section under Telephone (phone1) or Smartphone (phone2). Itâ€™s best to include the country code and the phone number, like for Germany +491234567. It's also acceptable to enter the number with a leading 0. The system will generate the complete number using the country code from the user field "country." If the number contains special characters, don't worry, they will be removed automatically.

2. My messages are not generating. It's automatically redirect to the participants overview. What should I do?
Please be sure, your browser allows to open the popups from WhatsApp. After that it will generate the messages

3. Why I have to click so many things before the message is in WhatsApp?
We advice to download the WhatsApp Application and set it like this you browser can open it automatically. 

4. My hardwares performance is very low when I generate the message. What can I do?
For every particaipant it opens one more tab. Please don't choose so lot of participants. After your performance will be better.

5. Do I always need a course to send the WhatsApp-messages?
Yes, because messages should always be sent within an educational setting and not for sending bulk messages. Setting this plugin in the system context could cause issues.

6. Some translations are not correct. Why?
The translation was created by a chatbot. Please report it or send me the correct lang-file.

7. I found a bug. How I can report?
